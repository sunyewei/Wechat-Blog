On February 24th, President Putin gave a speech on Russia-Ukraine relations and claimed that “Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist” and authorized a “special military operation” aiming at “demilitarise and denazify Ukraine”. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), at least US$1.7 billion is needed to support the Ukrainians who are suffering from the ongoing war and refugees who are fleeing to neighboring countries in East Europe (UNHCR, March 01, 2022). UNHCR estimates that around 1 million refugees have fled to neighboring countries in a week (UNHCR, March 03, 2022), and the number are very likely to continue to increase since there is no sign indicating that the war will end soon. 



New York Times journalist Lara Jakes, who expert in foreign policy and conflict reporting, published an article on the Ukrainian refugee issues on February 26th. In her article, her optimism towards Europe’s cosmopolitanism guides her to a heart-warming conclusion that Europe is willing to and well-prepared to accept Ukraine war refugees (Jakes, Feb 26, 2022). One of her key pieces of evidence is that even countries which are generally considered to be conservative on the refugee policies openly stated that they will grant permission to Ukrainian refugees to cross the borders that have been closed. Jakes’ report, alongside with many other articles which focus on the Ukraine war and related refugee issues, share some common mistakes which raises my significant concerns. First, they tend to over-simplify the complex political dynamic behind the Ukrainian refugee issue and view Ukrainian refugee relief as purely humanitarian behaviors. Since the refugee issues are caused by political behavior, it is almost impossible for refugee relief actions to be apolitical. Second, those reports simultaneously remain silent on the hidden narrative of xenophobia behind Western countries’ promise of welcoming and taking care of Ukrainian refugees. 



## 1. Can Ukrainian Refugee Issues and Relief be apolitical?

![Mearsheimer chicago](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunyewei/picgo/master/img/202203071659143.jpg)



The straight answer is **no**. The Refugees issues itself is caused by political conflicts. As early as 2014, Mearsheimer has stated that the United States and its European allies in NATO should be to blame for the Crimea crisis and President Putin’s aggressiveness (Mearsheimer, 2014). Mearsheimer’s main argument is that “NATO enlargement, EU expansion, and democracy promotion add fuel to a fire waiting to ignite” (McFaul et al., 2014; Mearsheimer, 2014). After the Ukraine-Russia war broke out, Mearsheimer reiterated this argument when he was interviewed by The New Yorker. He claimed that what Russia really wants is a part of Ukraine that is attuned to Moscow’s interest, a Ukraine that is neutral and not the puppet of the United States (Chotiner, March 1, 2022). Since it is clear that the ongoing war “is the continuation of politics by other means” (von Clausewitz et al., 1989, p. 87), **it is extremely hard for humanitarian actions to ignore the status quo and claim that their generosity is merely based cosmopolitanism and sympathy on war victims.**



![cosmopolitanism](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunyewei/picgo/master/img/202203071701053.jpg)



There are abundant for humanitarian organizations to insist that their actions are entirely value-free and neutral, for the idea of humanitarianism is connected to Immanuel Kant’s concept of cosmopolitanism (Barnett & Weiss, 2011) which imagines human beings as a single community and every member shares the “equal entitlement to dignity and to fundamental freedoms” (Starkey, 2012). The fundamental principles of humanitarianism lie in “humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality” (Pictet, 1979), which echo the utopian imagination of cosmopolitanism. Currently, the urgent basic needs of Ukrainian civilians necessary to be fulfilled fall into the traditional definition of ICRC’s definition of humanitarian actions (Barnett & Weiss, 2011). Based on the report released by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), battles that happened around the urban areas destroyed and disrupted the functioning of critical civilian infrastructures and cut off the supply of water, heating, and electricity. Food and medicine are in short supply (OCHA, March 04, 2022). Under such circumstances, humanitarian behaviors can hold their stand of being apolitical since their primary goal is to deliver relief to those affected by the conflict. However, the lack of funding makes humanitarian actions in Ukraine more complicated than “relief and nothing more than relief” (Barnett & Weiss, 2011). It is reported that there is currently $1.1 billion funding required for the relief actions in Ukraine to be deployed, and it is currently extremely underfunded (till March 5, 2022, only 5% of the funding required is fulfilled) (OCHA, March 05, 2022). The source of money to fulfill such needs can be highly questionable and political considering that the majority of humanitarian donation comes from bilateral and multilateral donors in OECD countries (Saez et al., 2021), which also are countries holding the authority to set up the agenda for global humanitarian issues (Macrae & Harmer, 2004). Under the status quo, such donation and assistance from Western countries will, in some ways, be interpreted as distinguishing their imagination from Putin. Compared to Putin’s aggressive dictatorship and imagination of a military oligarchy on Western press and social media, the Western world smartly portrays themselves as friendly liberalists by sending supplies and opening borders for war refugees, thus distinguishing themselves from Putin’s negative imagination. Despite at this moment, sending living supplies to Ukraine citizens and refugees are relief for the relief’s sake, donation and assistance towards Ukraine will surely be interpreted in a geopolitical consideration: Those humanitarian reliefs would be seen as functioning as propaganda material and continue banding post-war Ukraine, or at least the west part of Ukraine in the liberal and pro-Western side in the politically polarized world. 



The second challenging problem remaining for peacekeeping workers caring about Ukraine to solve is to what extent shall aid towards post-war Ukraine go? Since President Putin’s concern is mainly about geopolitical concerns and Russia’s strategic interests in Eastern Europe, he is not going to, and will not be able to conquer the whole territory of Ukraine (Chotiner, March 1, 2022), so the war shall certainly end soon once Putin achieve his strategical objectives. It is obvious that post-war reconstruction in Ukraine requires a significant investment of funds and resources since reports have confirmed that a lot of crucial civilian infrastructures were destroyed. This thus calls back the dilemma difference between the Minimalists and the Maximalists approach. The potential reconstruction of post-war Ukraine will undoubtedly fall into the Maximalists approach. In fieldwork, most maximalists proved gradual assistance to conflict zone based on a hierarchy-of-need approach (Burde, 2014). The goal of humanitarian assistance is to bring back “resilience and stabilization-based development and humanitarian assistance” (Gabiam, 2016) and utilize it as an instrument of peacebuilding. It is foreseeable that such a plausible approach will be heavily criticized for serving the political agenda of strong states and function as an advertisement of neo-liberalism. Another potential problem is the inefficiency, lack of coordination and consistency between multiple donors, and failure to provide stable aid funding flows. Currently, multiple bilateral and multilateral donors, including UNHCR, OCHA, ICRC, IRC (International Rescue Committee), EU Humanitarian Department, and USAID have stated that they will provide sustainable help to Ukraine. However, till now, there’s no framework for a sustainable humanitarian aid action released, and a reliable multilateral collaboration mechanism is still vacant. The past two decades of humanitarian relief aid in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq have indicated that “bad donorship” lacking an insightful advanced plan, effective coordination mechanism, and cooperation with local communities will result in anarchy and division of a nation-state (Goodhand, 2002). 



![Leine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunyewei/picgo/master/img/202203071702100.jpeg)



Another ironic thing that remains for the peacekeeping workers to solve is that the antinomy between Maximalists approaches and the cause of the Ukraine-Russia war. Different from the press just oversimplifying such situation as “Russia brutally invade his neighbor to support separatist”, the current scholarship in international relation and international law tend to view the current war on the extension line of the 2014 Crimean Crisis. Studies published at different time points have reached a fundamental agreement on Putin’s antipathy against EU’s and NATO’s enlargement, the attempt to militarize Crimean Peninsula and move Ukraine out of Russia’s sphere of influence (Chotiner, March 1, 2022; Elgström et al., 2018; Marxsen, 2014; Mearsheimer, 2014; Nitoiu, 2017). One of the main arguments Maximalists hold to legitimatize their enlarged scope of humanitarian action is to address social and economic inequities underlying the current social strata. Maximalists believe that humanitarian relief is closely coordinated, sometimes mixed with peacebuilding and the reconstruction of democracy (Barnett & Weiss, 2011; Gabiam, 2016; Goodhand, 2002). Such belief will lead them to a tangled, ambiguous relationship with politics. On the one hand, humanitarian workers need to lobby the politicians of the West to gain sufficient support for their relief and aid plan. On the other hand, when humanitarian workers investigate the geopolitical dynamics which trigger the concretization of the Ukraine-Russia War, they will disappointedly find that the war is all about great-power politics, and there are little things they are permitted to do with the money from bilateral and multilateral donors in the Western hemisphere. 



## 2. Imagination towards Ukrainian Refugees: An Alternative Form of Xenophobia

Another concern lingering in my mind when I read posts regarding Ukrainian Refugees is hidden racism and xenophobia. Lara Jakes’ report touched on similar issues by mentioning Northeastern University Professor Serena Parekh’s words that “It’s hard not to see that Ukrainians are white, mostly Christian and Europeans” (Jakes, Feb 26, 2022). It is not hard to see racism plays its part in the current situation. **The binarism that this sentence, alongside countless posts on social media incarnate, creates a narrative field of “either you are with orthodox Christianity, or you are with the infidels and devils.” It also brings us back to the “anachronistic division between ‘East’ and ‘West’” (Butler, 2006, p. 2), and create an antagonistic rhetorical metonymy of the division between Christian civilization and Slavonian/Mongolian barbarianism. Such prejudice and hypocrisy towards Ukraine Refugees is an echo of the anachronistic First Worldism the Bush government adopted after the 9.11 attack (Butler, 2006, pp. 1-18) (标出这一段只是因为它的行文风格很像朱迪斯·巴特勒，是我非常满意的一段). ** Things are getting worth when considering that the Ukrainians in North American TV series and movies are often portrayed as workers in lower-class jobs, including maid and doorman, and their appearance on the screen was mainly targeted at satisfying the exotic aesthetic of the Western audience. From a more realistic perspective, one may worry that the vast population flowing into urban areas of nearby Eastern European countries will raise serious concerns towards urban security. Moreover, as we can learn from the Syrian Refugee Crisis, the rapid and unplanned urbanization of refugees will put tremendous pressure on livelihood infrastructure and basic education facilities, increasing people’s risk and vulnerability to additional risk (Gabiam, 2016). Such vulnerabilities may increase the refugee’s negative impact on the crime rate, thus cause further discrimination against Ukrainian Refugees.

## 3. Conclusion

The main argument of this article contains two parts: the first part argues that it is unrealistic that the assistance targeting Ukrainian Refugees can be purely apolitical since the cause of this war is due to geopolitical reasons and conflict of interest between great-power nations. The second part put forward the concern that the hypocrisy towards Ukrainian Refugees immorally conceals the narrative of racism and xenophobia, and the absence of refugee support and placement agenda increases the risk of putting refugees into a situation lacking appropriate support for satisfying their basic livelihood needs.



Currently, the world has not seen evidence of reaching any modus vivendi between Ukraine and Russia. The additional military assistance for Ukraine from the EU and the US is making things further complicated (Blinken, February 26, 2022). Moreover, the re-existence of the cold war and ideological opposition language, the unvarnished hostility towards other civilizations and cultures, the ambiguous rules of the application of sanctions towards other nation-states, and the total ignorance of the charter of the United Nations and the Yalta System raise my personal concern. There are multiple risk signals that exist when the war goes on, and I personally hope every country and individual can learn something from this tragic event and together figure out a way not only to prevent regional conflicts but also increase understanding between people from different geographical, cultural and religious backgrounds.
